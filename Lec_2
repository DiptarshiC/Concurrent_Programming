memory hierarchy
OS Organization
Fork-join
Cache
Cache line
coherent
Cache indexing
cache miss
	1)cold miss
	2)Capacity miss
	3)Conflict Miss
Prefetching
	1)Stream
	2)Stride
Cache Locality
	1)Temporal: Something we used recently we used again
	2)Spacial: something that we used that will be near something else we will use
NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Access)

OS Organization

Process consists of
	1)System resources
www.linfo.org : Excellent resource for definitions

Thread : A running instance of executing instance of a sequential sequence of instructions 
Threads share
	1)Global various
	2)Heap(Two threads malloc to the same memory)

Threads DONOT share
	1)Stacks
	2)Registers
	3)Stack pointers
	4)Return value
Software Thread vs Hardware Thread
S/W thread
	Linux Task
H/W thread
	Hardware thread(Simultaneous multi-threading)

In linux
Both processes (single-threaded) processes and threads are tasks
Not much of a distinction

Context switching

A context switch is the switching the core from one process/thread to another

A context switch is sometimes described as the kernel suspending execution of one task
