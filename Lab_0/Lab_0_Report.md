# Lab 0 Report

## Aim

The aim of the lab was to take a file having a random number of  unsorted inputs on
the commandline,to sort it out using either Quicksort or Mergesort and to print the
output to another file whose name would be specified by the second commandline arg.

## Algorithm chosen

I have chosen the **QuickSort** algorithm over the mergesort algorithm for the following reasons

1. Time Complexity : Best Case     : **O(nlogn)**
		     ,Average Case : **O(nlogn)**
		     ,Worst Case   : **O(n^2)**
2. Space Complexity: Average Case  : **O(logn)**
	             ,Worst Case   : **O(n)**
